How-to install Slint version 14.1 with a Braille terminal using brltty.

The 32 and 64 bit editions of the Slint installers for Slackware version 14.1
contain the brltty software, allowing blind users to use them, then use the
installed system, through a Braille terminal.

The "small" hybrid (USB or CD) images of the Slint installers
(version 14.1) are available in http://slint.fr/installers alongside their
respective md5 checksum files. They don't include the Slackware packages.
Reminder: only the version 14.1 (32 and 64 bit) ships brltty.

The  "full" hybrid (USB or DVD) ISO images (including all Slackware packages)
are available here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/slint/files/14.1/

General instructions for use of all the installer images are in:
http://slint.fr/installer.html

You can check the integrity of theses "full" ISO images  with their md5
or sha1 checksums:
md5  for slint64-14.1.3-full.iso ee839aa09ecc2fa924ebb1dae1d09663
sha1 for slint64-14.1.3-full.iso 130f32eac7112e723fb2a6b377aa7bbf8eb5a7ba
md5  for slint-14.1.3-full.iso c1c399efa41416fa72a38dbca7bf0775
sha1 for slint-14.1.3-full.iso 14312f82f3e2cb7f1cff80a1c04c5f0b4d1ef856

Just download the ISO image, use it to make a bootable DVD or USB stick,
boot off that media and when you hear a 'beep' type the command line in the
form <language code> brltty=<driver code>,<device>,<text table>. For
instance to install with a Papenmeier device connected through USB with a
French text table, type:
06 brltty=pm,usb:,fr_FR
then press [Enter]

Here is the list of language codes, all UTF8 encoded:
04 Dutch * 05 English (USA) * 06 French * 07 German * 08 Greek * 11 Polish
12 Portuguese (Brazil) * 13 Portuguese (Portugal) * 15 Russian
17 Spanish (Latin America) * 19 Swedish * 20 Turkish * 21 Ukrainian

A few seconds after pressing [Enter] the startup messages should be
displayed on the Braille terminal.

Limitation: the 64 bit installer, if used on an UEFI firmware (not in legacy
mode) uses a GRUB bootloader that needs the help of a sighted person to edit
(instead of just typing) an existing command line to include "brltty=...".

Your settings will be recorded in the installed system in /etc/brltty.conf,
and brltty will be launched at startup by default, unless you make the file
/etc/rc.d/rc.brltty non executable, typing:
chmod 0644 /etc/rc.d/rc.brltty

Also, if you plug in a Braille terminal connected through USB when the
system is running, it should become operational as relevant udev rules
should launch a brltty daemon with the proper driver.

You can consult the Slint website @ http://slint.fr to know more.

A comprehensive manual for brltty is available in English, French and
Portuguese in several formats including plain text (txt) at this URL:
