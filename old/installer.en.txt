= Slint installer

Slint installer allows you to use your prefered language during installation, and add translated administration tools and manual pages to Slackware.

A 'Braille terminal' can also be used to install then pilot the system. Instructions for use are available in https://slint.fr/docs/README_BRLTTY.

== Download and check installer's ISO image
Two sizes of ISO images are available:

* The http://sourceforge.net/projects/slint/files/[DVD + USB full ISO images] contain all you need to install Slackware.
* The https://slint.fr/installers[CD + USB small ISO images] need to be completed by a media containing the Slackware packages, for instance a Slackware DVD.

To download a full ISO image, first click on its version number, for instance 14.1.

You can check the integrity of the ISO image with its md5 check sum.

* For the small ISO images, downloading and using its associated md5 file (whose name ends in .md5).
* For the full ISO image, you can display the check sum clicking on the letter i in a black circle on the right of the link to the ISO image.
 
For instance to make a polyglot installer of an internationalized Slackware64-14.1, download the ISO image (and the md5 file, in case of a small installer) then in the same directory type for instance one of following commands
----
md5sum -c slint64-14.1.iso.md5 # answer should be: OK
md5sum slint64-14.1-full.iso # the result should be the same as displayed on the website
----
== Burn the ISO image on a DVD, a CD or an USB stick

=== Make a bootable USB stick

[WARNING]
====
* All previous content of the USB stick will be LOST
* Re-read carefully your command to make sure that you didn't write the name of a hard disk partition instead of that of the USB stick as this partition's content would be IRRECOVERABLY LOST
====

On 'Linux' plug in the USB stick, then check its name with following commands:

----
cat /proc/partitions
dmesg | tail
----

If its name is /dev/sdc for instance, type:

----
dd if=<filename.iso> of=/dev/sdc bs=1M
----

On 'Windows' use application http://rufus.akeo.ie/[Rufus] that is free and open source.

=== Make a bootable CD (small installer) or DVD (big installer)

On 'Linux' type a command like the first one below for a CD, or the second one for a DVD.

----
cat slint64-14.1.iso | cdrecord -v dev=/dev/cdrw speed=10 fs=8m -tao -eject -data -
growisofs -speed=2 -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr0=slint64-14.1-full.iso
----


On 'Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7' use application http://infrarecorder.org/[InfraRecorder] that is free and open source.


On 'Windows 7/8' use http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Burn-a-CD-or-DVD-from-an-ISO-file[Windows Disk Image Burner], shipped with Windows 7 and 8

== Use your polyglot installer

Just insert the installation media (CD, DVD or USB stick) and reboot your machine.

On the greeting screen, you will choose your prefered language for installation typing the corresponding two digits code.

Beyond being polyglot, the Slint installers offer following features in addition to those of the genuine Slackware installers:

* Default font and keymap are adapted to the language used for installation.
* Whenever possible, a True Type font is used during installation, to automatically adapt the font size to the screen's resolution (for Slackware versions 14.0 and 14.1 only).
* Option to create regular user accounts at end of installation (before rebooting) is provided.
* Options are provided to set as defaults in the installed system the language and keymap used during installation, and make corresponding settings of keyboard under X if the X server is installed.
* A Slint package is installed, that provides translations of the main Slackware tools and their manual pages, listed in link:package.html[Slint package], as well as documents put in /usr/doc/slint-<version>-<date>, including a Slint-HOWTO.txt and a script reinstall-slackware-packages.sh.

If you use the small version of the installer, during installation you will also need a 'source media', in other words a media containing Slackware packages. Packages can be installed from a Slackware DVD/CDs, a Slackware USB stick, a pre-mounted directory, a hard drive partition, a Samba share, NFS (Network File System), a FTP/HTTP server. When choosing the SOURCE in the menu, the installer tells you what to do according to the kind of selected media.

To get a source media, follow this link: http://www.slackware.com/getslack/[Get Slack]

TIP: If need be you can replace the installation media by another one containing the packages, as at time of installing the packages the installer will have been already loaded in memory.
