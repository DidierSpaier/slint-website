= Slint package

Slint package contains polyglot administration tools and manual pages as well as translation files, provided by the Slint project.

This page explains how to get and install it, then describes its content so you know what is translated in which languages.

Slint package's scope will expand gradually, so just ugrading it will allow you to get updated and newly translated tools and translations in more languages as soon as they become available.

== Download and install or upgrade a Slint package

If you just used Slint installer, there is no need to install the Slint package in addition: that's already done by the installer.

A Slint package is provided for each supported Slackware edition (Slackware 13.37, Slackware 14.0 and Slackware 14.1) in directory https://slint.fr/packages[packages/]. The same package can be installed on 32 bit and 64 versions. To get, check and install (or upgrade) 'Slint package' (for Slackware 14.1 in this example), do this:

----
wget -r -l1 -np -nd -A slint-14.1*  https://slint.fr/packages/ # you will get the most recent Slint package and its associated md5 file
md5sum -c slint-14.1*md5 # answer should be "OK", else downloaded package is corrupt
su # get root's privileges
upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall slint-14.1*txz # this command installs or upgrade the package
----

TIP: To prevent 'slackpkg' from removing 'Slint package', add a line to /etc/slackpkg/blacklist with only this word: +
slint
