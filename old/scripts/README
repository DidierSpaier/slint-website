Usage of the scripts in this directory
-------------------------------------

These scripts are used to maintain the website slint.fr and manage its
localized pages.

The website is generated from the text files stored in ~/slint.fr/, using
the asciidoc application to convert these text files to xhtml web pages.

The po4a application is used to convert AsciiDooc formatted text files to
PO files suitable for processing by gettext and back.

The translations are managed and hosted using the Transifex localization
platform.

This conversion is done by the script build-site-website.sh that generates
the web pages and store them in a subdirectory per language.

Ths text files stored in ~/slint.fr/ are either "source" files (in English)
or translations of source files.

Here is the whole process of translation and site (re)building:

In case of a creation or updsate of a source file:
Writing of the text source file
1. Generation of the POT file by the script toolbox.sh
2. Upload on Transifex of the POT file using the Transifex client
3. Generation of one PO file per locale by Transifex
4. Translation of the PO file on line or uploaded to Transifex
5. Downloading of the translated PO file from Transifex to
  ~/MYENV/slintwebsite/translations using the Transifex client
6. Generation of the translated text files and of coresponding web pages from
   the translated PO file by the script update_translations.sh, respectively
   stored in ~/slint.fr/wip_txt and ~/slint.fr/wip_html respectively
7. Visual checking of the content of genrated files and web pages
8. Manual move of the translated text files from ~/slint.fr/wip_txt to
  ~/slint.fr

In case of update of one or several translations the process begins at step 5.
