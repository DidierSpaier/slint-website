Thanks to our dozens of link:translators[benevolent translators] Slint makes that dream a reality.

The Slint project is neither affiliated to nor endorsed by Slackware[blue]^<<note-1,[1]>>^ but need it, so we encourage all Slint users to https://store.slackware.com/cgi-bin/store[financially support] Slackware.

.The Slint Project provides:
* Polyglot 'Slint installers', available for Slackware 13.37, 14.0 and 14.1
* 'Slint packages', that replace Slackware administration tools with polyglot ones and install translation files and some documents.

All 'Slint installers' installs a 'Slint package' for the same Slackware version, that can also be installed in a genuine Slackware, and upgraded as need be.

== Install Slackware in your language or internationalize it afterwards

.Install Slackware in your language using a 'Slint installer'
Two sizes of ISO images are available, both allowing to make bootable installers:

* The http://sourceforge.net/projects/slint/files/[DVD + USB full ISO images] contain all you need to install Slackware.
* The https://slint.fr/installers[CD + USB small ISO images] need to be completed by a media containing the Slackware packages, for instance a Slackware DVD.

See page link:installer.html[Slint installer] to know how to download the image, put it on a DVD or USB stick and use it.

A Braille terminal can also be used to install then pilot the system. Instructions for use are available in https://slint.fr/docs/README_BRLTTY.

.Internationalize your genuine Slackware or upgrade translations tools (re)installing a 'Slint package'
Slint packages are located in directory https://slint.fr/packages[packages/]. See page link:package.html[Slint package] to know how to install a Slint package for your Slackware edition and what you get for your money :-)

Install or reinstall a 'Slint package' if you want to:

* internationalize an already installed Slackware 13.37, 14.0 or 14.1 (if you didn't use a Slint installer)
* get new translated tools, fixes and translations in new languages.

== Use your polyglot Slackware

NOTE: A locale is the definition of the subset of a user's environment that depends on language and cultural conventions.
[[anchor-1]]
.Set up your preferred locale
The Slint installer makes default locale settings in installed system according to language used during installation, but if you installed  a Slint package to internationalize a genuine Slackware you'll need to make these settings yourself. 

To view messages in your preferred language, just set the LANG parameter accordingly in file /etc/profile.d/lang.sh[blue]^<<note-2,[2]>>^
For instance, to display messages in Brazilian Portuguese, you would replace the `en_US` default setting like this:

----
export LANG=pt_BR.utf8 # locale  name should end in .utf8 to match UTF-8 encoding of translated messages 
----
Also , to properly display translated manual pages that are encoded in UTF-8, insert 'one' of following commands in your ~/.bashrc:

----
export GROFF_ENCODING=utf8 # If all man pages you read are either in English or encoded in UTF-8
alias uman="GROFF_ENCODING=utf8 man" # If you also read man pages in other encodings
----
If you use the latter, you will type "uman" instead of "man" in a terminal to display manual pages encoded in UTF-8.

.Administrate Slackware in your language
'Slint installers' as well as 'Slint packages' replace main Slackware tools by polyglot ones, and add translated man pages.

All polyglot tools currently available are listed in page link:package#what_is_translated[Slint package]. They allow you to:
[options="compact"]
* Manage software packages
* Add users
* (re)configure your system: decide which system daemons (services) to start at boot time, create new users, reconfigure your boot loader, choose default windows manager or desktop, configure your network, make an USB Linux boot stick
